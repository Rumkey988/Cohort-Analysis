# Customer Retention Analytics
## Project Objective 
The goal of this project was to build an interactive customer retention analytics dashboard in Power BI to help businesses understand their customer lifecycle, identify trends in customer behavior, and make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention and marketing ROI.
## Questions 
This dashboard addresses the following key questions:
1.	How many customers are retained over time, and which cohorts are most at risk of churn?
2.	What is the average lifetime value (LTV) of customers by cohort and acquisition source?
3.	How do customer retention, churn, and sales vary across marketing channels and age groups?
4.	Which customer segments are most profitable, and where should retention efforts be focused?
5.	How do new, returning, and recovered customers behave across cohort months?
6.	Can we predict future churn and anticipate changes in customer behavior?
